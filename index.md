I am the author of three books of poetry: _Night Music_ (2018), _Udon by the Remarkables_ (2016) and _Moonshot_ (2008).

My poetry has appeared in numerous journals in New Zealand and overseas. I am also the co-author, with Latika Vasil, of the book _Asperger Syndrome, Adolescence, and Identity: Looking Beyond the Label_.

My most recent work: Two new poems published online in [Tarot](http://www.tarotpoetry.nz/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tarot-06.pdf).
