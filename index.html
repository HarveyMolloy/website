I amm the author of three books of poetry: _Night Music_ (2018), _Udon by the Remarkables_ (2016) and _Moonshot_ (2008).

My poetry has appeared in numerous journals in New Zealand and overseas. I am also the co-author, with Latika Vasil, of the book _Asperger Syndrome, Adolescence, and Identity: Looking Beyond the Label_.

My most recent work is the short fiction [Fury](https://idleink.org/2022/01/01/fury-by-harvey-molloy/) published by [Idle Ink](https://idleink.org/).
